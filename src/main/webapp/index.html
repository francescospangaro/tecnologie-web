	<!-- DIFFERENT INPUT TAGS HAVE DIFFERENT VALIDATION OPTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE "REQUIRED"  
		 https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_input_required
		 OR MIN MAX VALUES FOR NUMBERS:
		 https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_input_max_min
		 USE ALL OF THEM WHEN POSSIBLE, EVEN IF ALL CHECKS ARE DONE SERVER SIDE.
	-->
	<p> <b>Note 1</b>: in these examples to test the corner cases we did not use the HTML tag "REQUIRED", but it should be added when possible. As well as other tags for validation (e.g. min and max for number input)</p>
	
	<p> <b>Note 2</b>: in the examples  to list and add courses, the class CourseManager acts as a "mock-up" of the the database. As you advance in the course you will learn to create classes to write and read from the database and that will be the standard for the course.</p>
